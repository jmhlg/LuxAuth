# LuxAuth
A blockchain-powered platform for the fashion and luxury goods industry that combats counterfeiting, ensures supply chain transparency, and fosters brand communities by tokenizing authenticity certificates, enabling resale royalties, and rewarding loyal customers — all on-chain using Clarity smart contracts.
---
## Overview
LuxAuth consists of five main smart contracts that together form a decentralized, transparent, and secure ecosystem for luxury brands, consumers, and resellers:
1. **Authenticity NFT Contract** – Issues and manages NFTs as digital certificates of authenticity for physical luxury items.
2. **Supply Chain Tracker Contract** – Records immutable supply chain events from production to delivery.
3. **Resale Royalty Contract** – Automates royalties on secondary market sales and tracks ownership history.
4. **Loyalty Token Contract** – Issues brand-specific tokens for customer rewards and community engagement.
5. **Governance DAO Contract** – Enables token holders to vote on brand proposals, such as limited edition releases.
